# Min-Max-Classifier
A 2-class classifier based on Min-Max Modular Neural Network

    This is the course project of EI328 in SJTU, which is delivered by Lv Baoliang, a professor who introduced the idea of min-max modular neural network in machine learning.
    We are required to implement a 2-class classifier, which is applied in massive Japaneses patent classification. Data files data/train.txt and data/test.txt are provided by course TA, both of which have been well pre-processed. Our task is to implement the min-max modular neural network to solve this problem, based on both the library LIBLINEAR and a basic classifier we made in our own right.
    This project has been largely refactored from what I have submitted during that course, and I have given some brief explanations in the expurgated lab report in the doc directory.

Something I shall bear in mind in future software development:
  (1) Keep It Simple and Stupid. (KISS)
  (2) Stop trying to reinvent the wheel.
  (3) Don't Repeat Yourself. (DRY)
  (4) Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
  (5) Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
