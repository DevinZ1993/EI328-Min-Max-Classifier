# Min-Max-Classifier
A 2-class classifier based on Min-Max Modular Neural Network

Something I shall bear in mind in future software development:
  (1) Keep It Simple and Stupid. (KISS)
  (2) Stop trying to reinvent the wheel.
  (3) Don't Repeat Yourself. (DRY)
  (4) Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
  (5) Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
